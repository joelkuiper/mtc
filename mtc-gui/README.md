GeMTC GUI - Mixed Treatment Comparison model generation
=======================================================

[GeMTC][1] GUI provides a graphical interface to manage Mixed Treatment
Comparison (MTC) data files and generate analysis models. MTC is also
known as Network Meta-Analysis.

The software is capable of generating JAGS and BUGS models for both
dichotomous and continuous data structures. The data is provided in an
XML file and processed by the library to generate the correct
parametrization, whether a consistency, an inconsistency or a node-split
model.

Several flavours of GeMTC are available:

  * A graphical user interface (GUI) application with built-in data
    management and model generation capabilities. The generated models
    can be run using JAGS or BUGS.

  * A command line interface (CLI) program to generate JAGS/BUGS from
	data files provided on the command line. The generated models can be
    run using JAGS or BUGS.

  * An R package that combines the GeMTC library and JAGS to provide
    full analysis capabilities (EXPERIMENTAL).

  * A Java library  that can also run the MTC models using the YADAS
    pure Java MCMC package. This option is used by [ADDIS][2] to perform
    network meta-analysis.

Several example XML files are provided with the GeMTC distribution to
demonstrate the capabilities of the library. All examples were taken
from published network meta-analyses, and the references to the original
papers are in the respective XML files.

Requirements
------------

GeMTC is built in [Java][3], and requires Java 6 (JRE 1.6) or newer. To
run the generated models, you need [JAGS][4] 3.0 or newer, or
[OpenBUGS][5], or [WinBUGS][6]. You may want to use [R][7] to perform
post-processing and analysis.

Running GeMTC GUI
-----------------

Double click the mtc-gui-0.10.jar file, and click "Open" to open an
existing data file (e.g. those provided in the examples directory) or
"New" to create a new one.

Versions
--------

0.12.2: Bugfixes.

0.12.2: Bugfixes and minor improvements.

0.12.1: Sort studies and treatments alphabetically, fix flaw in prior
generation, and other bugfixes. Improve integration with ADDIS and allow
the simulation to be extended after assessment of convergence.

0.12: Complete rewrite in Java, redesigned node-splitting model
generation.

0.10.1: Bugfixes, generate R code for JAGS models.

0.10: Addition of GUI module, improved consistency model generation,
support for BUGS. Renamed to GeMTC CLI and GeMTC GUI.

0.8: Starting value generation for JAGS models, JAGS node-split models,
provide R code for analysis.

0.6: Node-splitting models, assessment of convergence, starting value
generation, allow access to samples (all for YADAS only, JAGS models
have not advanced). Modularized into 4 libraries.

0.4: Improved parametrization algorithm. Allow output of Network as XML.
Check connectedness of network. Some issues fixed.

0.2: Initial release. JAGS and YADAS model generation. Java API for
running MTC models.

Building from source
--------------------

Source code can be obtained from [the GeMTC site][1]. In order to build
GeMTC you need:

 - [Java >= 1.5][3]
 - [Maven 2][8]
 - Other dependencies are downloaded automatically by Maven

To build, use "mvn package". Due to downloading dependencies, the first
time this may take a while.
